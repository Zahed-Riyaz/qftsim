# QFT Simulation Package

This a package which aims to provide tools for simulating quantum field theories (QFT), including interacting scalar \(\phi^4\) theory in 2D and 3D.

## Features
- Symbolic Lagrangian definitions with Sympy.
- Field and propagator classes.
- Monte Carlo simulation routines (1D, 2D, and 3D).
- Example scripts and visualization tools.
